# A Python Primer ("Prymer")

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the on-campus version of CSE 6040: Computing for Data Analysis.

> A good starting point is [`index.ipynb`](./index.ipynb). You'll find some exercises in [`exercises`](./exercises). The quick "live preview" demo we did in the first few minutes of the class will eventually appear in [`dummy-live-demo-0.ipynb`](./dummy-live-demo-0.ipynb).

These materials were adapted from [Jake Vanderplas's "Whirlwind Tour of Python"](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/).
